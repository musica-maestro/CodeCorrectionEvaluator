I'll grade the student's submission according to the provided criteria.

<feedback_summary>
Strengths:
- Good implementation of file handling with proper open/close operations
- Correct implementation of the maximum finding logic
- Well-structured recursive approach for checking even maximums
- Clear separation of concerns between different functions

Areas for Improvement:
1. Base Case in massimoPari:
   - The base case logic needs refinement for arrays shorter than 3 elements
   - Consider what should be returned when the array is too short for triplets

2. Variable Initialization:
   - The counter variable 'quanti' in quantiNumeri() function needs initialization
   - Uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior

3. Error Handling:
   - File operation error messages could be more descriptive
   - Consider returning error codes instead of just printing messages

Key Recommendations:
1. Initialize all variables before use, especially counters
2. Revise the base case in massimoPari to handle arrays with length < 3 more appropriately
3. Add more descriptive error messages for file operations
4. Consider adding input validation for array lengths and file operations
</feedback_summary>

The student's implementation is generally good, with minor issues in initialization and base case handling. The core functionality is well implemented, particularly the recursive checking of even maximums in triplets. The file handling is properly structured with appropriate open/close operations, though error handling could be improved.
