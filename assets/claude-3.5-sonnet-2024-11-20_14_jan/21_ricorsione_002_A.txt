<feedback_summary>
Strengths:
- Correct implementation of file operations (reading, writing, counting)
- Proper error handling for file operations
- Good implementation of recursive logic in massimoPari function
- Appropriate use of binary file operations

Areas for Improvement:
1. massimoPari function:
   - Could be simplified using helper functions for better readability
   - Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., 'vero' could be 'isMaxEven')
   - Complex boolean expression could be broken down for better maintainability

2. Code Structure:
   - Consider adding more comments to explain complex logic
   - Could benefit from better variable naming conventions
   - Consider breaking down complex conditions into smaller, more manageable pieces

Key Recommendations:
1. Implement helper functions to handle complex operations
2. Use more descriptive variable names
3. Add comments to explain complex logic
4. Consider breaking down complex boolean expressions into smaller parts
5. Add more detailed error messages for file operations

The code is functionally correct but could be improved in terms of readability and maintainability.
