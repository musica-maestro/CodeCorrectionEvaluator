<feedback_summary>
Strengths:
- Correct implementation of file operations (reading, writing, counting)
- Proper use of binary file operations with fread/fwrite
- Good error handling for file operations
- Correct recursive implementation for checking even maximums
- Well-structured main function with clear user interaction

Areas for Improvement:
- The base case in massimoPari function needs revision:
  - Current implementation with lunghezza == 2 could lead to array access issues
  - Should use lunghezza <= 2 as base case since we're checking triplets
  - Current implementation might access memory outside array bounds

Key Recommendations:
1. Modify the base case in massimoPari to handle arrays with length <= 2 properly
2. Add additional error checking for array bounds
3. Consider adding more descriptive output messages to explain the results

The code is overall well-implemented with just a few minor issues. The main concern is the base case in the recursive function, which could lead to potential array access problems. The file handling portions are particularly well done with proper error checking and resource management.
