<feedback_summary>
Strengths:
- Correct implementation of file operations (reading, writing, counting)
- Proper use of binary file operations with fread and fwrite
- Good error handling for file operations
- Recursive implementation of minimoDispari function
- Clear main function structure with user interaction

Areas for Improvement:
- Base case handling in minimoDispari function needs revision:
  - Current implementation allows access to array elements that might be out of bounds
  - Base case should properly handle arrays with length < 3
- Consider adding more descriptive error messages for file operations
- Could improve variable naming (e.g., "risposta" could be more descriptive)

Key Recommendations:
1. Modify the base case in minimoDispari to:
   ```c
   if(lunghezza < 3) {
       return 1;  // or appropriate value based on requirements
   }
   ```
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
3. Consider using more descriptive variable names to improve code readability
4. Add comments to explain the logic, especially in the recursive function

The code is overall well-implemented with just a few minor issues in the recursive function's base case handling. The file operations are particularly well done with proper error checking and resource management.
