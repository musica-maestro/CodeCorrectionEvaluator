Make an application that consists of five functions.
- (5 pt) A recursive minimumOdd function that tests whether, in an array of integers, each triple of consecutive integers in the sequence is such that the minimum among the three integers is odd. For example, the minimumOdd function must return the value 1 if the parameter array is [-7,6,10,-3], since the minimum in the triple [-7,6,10] is odd and the minimum in the triple [6,10,-3] is odd. The function minimumOdd has two parameters: the array and its length. In case you want to use a third parameter to realize recursion, an additional function must be defined minimumOddRec that has three parameters and realizes recursion. In that case, the function minimumOdd invokes the minimumOddRec function.
- (1 pt) A writeNumbers function that writes the values of an array of integers to a file. The function receives as a parameter the array and its length. The file should be called integers.dat (in case it is binary) or integers.txt (in case it is textual). The choice of whether to use a binary file or a text file is left to the student.
- (2 pt) A howManyNumbers function that determines how many integers are stored on a file named integers.dat (in the case of using a binary file) or integers.txt (in the case of use a text file).
- (2 pt) A readNumbers function that reads a sequence of integers from a file named integers.dat (in case you are using a binary file) or integers.txt (in case you are using a text file) and stores them on an array that is received as a parameter.
