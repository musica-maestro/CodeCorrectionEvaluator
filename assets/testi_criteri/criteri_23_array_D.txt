FUNCTION
//******** INCORRECT INDENTATION!!!! -0.5
//******** COMPARING LENGTH WITH ARRAY CONTENT -1.5
//******** CONSIDERING 0 AS NEGATIVE -0.2
//******** COMPARING AN INTEGER WITH A CHARACTER! -1.5
//******** PRINT A MESSAGE FOR EVERY TRIPLE YOU EXAMINE! -2
//******** ACCENTED CHARACTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED -0.5
//******** FUNCTION IS NOT PRESENT, EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN IN THE MAIN -1.5
//******** DECLARING THE ARRAY IN THE LOOP! -1
//******** ARRAY INDEX OUT OF BOUNDS -1
//******** MISSING IF PART -1
//******** THIS IS NOT AN EXISTENTIAL VERIFICATION BUT A UNIVERSAL ONE -2
//******** 2 RETURNS IS NOT STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING -0.5
//******** 3 RETURNS IS NOT STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING -1
//******** 4 RETURNS IS NOT STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING -1.5
//******** CONDITION ON THE TRIPLE IS WRONG -1.5
//******** TWO OR THREE COMBINATIONS ON THE TRIPLE CONDITION ARE MISSING  -1
//******** seq[l] IS NOT AN ARRAY, IT'S THE FIRST MEMORY LOCATION AFTER THE END OF THE ARRAY -1
//******** THIS WAY YOU CHECK IF THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO POSITIVES, NOT EXACTLY TWO -1.5
//******** RETURN THE CALCULATED VALUE ON THE FIRST TRIPLE, SINCE WITH RETURN YOU EXIT THE ITERATION IMMEDIATELY. -2
//******** MISSING PARAMETERS FOR THE FUNCTION int seq[] AND length -1.5
//******** THE TEXT REQUIRES THE PRINT TO BE DONE IN THE MAIN, NOT IN THE FUNCTION -1.5
//******** YOU SHOULD NOT DECLARE THE ARRAY AND LENGTH HERE, THEY MUST BE PASSED AS PARAMETERS -1
//******** seq[l] IS NOT THE ARRAY, IT'S AN ELEMENT THAT DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ARRAY -1
//******** RETURN THE CALCULATED VALUE ON THE LAST TRIPLE -1.5
//******** USELESS SET OF THE BOOLEAN VARIABLE TO 1 MULTIPLE TIMES -0.5
//******** BECAUSE YOU PLACED THE BOOLEAN IN THE LOOP CONDITION -0.5
//******** WITHOUT THE BOOLEAN VARIABLE IN THE CONDITION, EVEN IF YOU FIND A TRIPLE THAT SATISFIES THE PROPERTY, YOU CONTINUE TO CHECK -0.2
//******** THE FUNCTION MUST RETURN A VALUE, HERE THE RETURN IS IN THE ELSE -1.5

MAIN
//******** WRONG ORDERING FOR ARRAY DECLARATION, YOU MUST READ THE LENGTH BEFORE DECLARING THE ARRAY -0.5
//******** MISSING DECLARATION OF THE ARRAY -1
//******** THERE IS LITTLE EXPLANATION OF THE CALLED FUNCTION RESULT (LITTLE IMPRECISIONS ON PROPERTY THE SEQUENCE SATISFIES) -0.2
//******** THERE IS POOR EXPLANATION OF THE CALLED FUNCTION RESULT (DOES NOT SPECIFY AT ALL WHICH PROPERTY THE SEQUENCE SATISFIES) -0.5
//******** THERE IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE CALLED FUNCTION RESULT -1
//******** MISSING SPACE -0.1
//******** INCORRECT READING, SHOULD BE &seq[i] -0.5
